# osu-Randomizer

Alpha Version

Randomize maps you play in osu!

Annoyances for now:
1. You have to manually insert your own API in the code
2. You have to manually run the script
3. Zero customization (you can search only for
   - osu!standard maps
   - with more than 200 combo
   - or ANYTHING ranked)
4. UI is super rough but with peak UX

Things which work for now:
1. Automatically updates highest ID every 24 hours.
2. Randomizes maps! (WOW)

First solo thing i did.
